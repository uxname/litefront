## Architecture

This boilerplate uses **[Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)](https://feature-sliced.design)**, a methodology for structuring frontend applications. It helps to keep the codebase clean, scalable, and easy to navigate by organizing code into layers (`shared`, `entities`, `features`, `widgets`, `pages`, `app`).

## Key Features

- **Automated Type Generation**: `npm run gen` command to generate TypeScript types from your GraphQL schema and operations.
- **Environment Consistency**: Custom Vite plugin ensures `.env` and `.env.example` are always in sync during development.
- **Optimized for Production**: Multi-stage Dockerfile for small and secure production images, served by the high-performance Caddy web server.
- **Image Optimization**: Automatic image optimization at build time with `vite-plugin-image-optimizer`.
- **Pre-configured Tooling**: Linters, formatters, and git-hooks are set up and ready to go.

## Perfect Pairing with [LiteEnd](https://github.com/uxname/liteend)

This LiteFront boilerplate is best suited for use with [LiteEnd](https://github.com/uxname/liteend), as they are
designed to work seamlessly together. LiteEnd provides a backend that integrates smoothly with LiteFront via GraphQL and
TypeScript, enabling a cohesive full-stack development experience.

## Get Started

### One-Liner

```bash
npx degit uxname/litefront my-app && cd my-app && git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit" && npm install && cp .env.example .env && npm run gen && npm run start:dev
```

### Step-by-Step

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    npx degit uxname/litefront my-app
    cd my-app
    ```
2.  **Initialize Git**
    ```bash
    git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial commit"
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Setup environment variables**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    # Edit .env with your configuration
    ```
5.  **Generate GraphQL types**
    ```bash
    npm run gen
    ```
6.  **Run the development server**
    ```bash
    npm run start:dev
    ```
Your app should now be running on the port specified in your `.env` file (default: `http://localhost:3000`).

## Types Generation

Run `npm run gen` after every change to the GraphQL API Schema or after modifying any `*.graphql` files in the `src/graphql` directory. This command is crucial for maintaining type safety between your frontend and backend.
